# Privacy manifest — collected data declarations

This document explains every entry under `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypes`
in `app/Sources/App/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`, and how each engineering
declaration must be mirrored on the App Store Connect "App Privacy"
nutrition label at submission time.

## What the manifest declares

`PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` lists three collected data types, every one of
which is `Linked = true`, `Tracking = false`, and serves the
`AppFunctionality` purpose:

| `NSPrivacyCollectedDataType` | What flows through the network | App Store Connect label section |
|---|---|---|
| `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypeDeviceID` | The `X-Device-UUID` header attached to every backend request (see *Where the identifier comes from* below). | *Identifiers → Device ID* |
| `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypeOtherFinancialInfo` | `BackendPortfolioPayload.monthlyBudget` and every `BackendHoldingPayload.weight` transmitted by `BackendSyncProjection.makePayload(for:deviceUUID:)`. | *Financial Info → Other Financial Info* |
| `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypeOtherUserContent` | `BackendPortfolioPayload.name` (the user-typed portfolio name) and the per-holding `BackendHoldingPayload.ticker` string. | *User Content → Other User Content* |

The mapping between manifest field and the App Store Connect nutrition
label for every entry is:

| Manifest field | App Store Connect label section |
|---|---|
| `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypeLinked = true` | *Linked to the user* |
| `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypeTracking = false` | *Not used to track you* |
| `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypePurposeAppFunctionality` | *App Functionality* |

The Connect form must match the manifest exactly; mismatch is a
common §5.1.2 rejection cause.

## Where the identifier comes from

- `app/Sources/Backend/Networking/DeviceIDProvider.swift` lazily
  generates a `UUID().uuidString` on first use, persists it in the
  Keychain under `com.valuecompass.deviceUUID`, and returns the same
  value on every subsequent call. The identifier survives reinstall
  (within Apple's keychain accessibility constraints) and is never
  rotated client-side.
- `app/Sources/Backend/Networking/APIClient.swift` calls
  `makeOutgoingRequest(...)` which sets the
  `X-Device-UUID` request header on **every** outbound backend call
  via `URLSession`.
- `app/Sources/App/Dependencies/APIClientDependency.swift` wires
  `APIClient.shared.send(_:)` into `@Dependency(\.apiClient)`. Any
  reducer that resolves this dependency transmits the identifier
  automatically.

The backend (`backend/api/main.py`) accepts `device_uuid: UUID`
and joins it onto `Portfolio` rows, which is what makes the manifest
entry **linked** rather than unlinked.

## Where the financial info and user content come from

- `app/Sources/Backend/Networking/BackendSyncProjection.swift:8–15`
  defines `BackendPortfolioPayload.{name, monthlyBudget, maWindow,
  createdAt}` and `BackendHoldingPayload.{ticker, weight}`. The
  `monthlyBudget` and per-holding `weight` decimals are user-supplied
  financial figures derived from the portfolio editor (#125).
- `BackendSyncProjection.makePayload(for:deviceUUID:)` assembles those
  values from the live SwiftData `Portfolio` row before the projection
  hands the payload to `APIClient`.
- The payload then travels over TLS to `https://api.valuecompass.app`
  alongside the `X-Device-UUID` header, which is why both new entries
  carry `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypeLinked = true` — the backend joins
  every payload row to the per-installation identifier.

## Why these flag values are correct

- **Linked = `true`** (all three entries): the backend persists rows
  keyed by the `X-Device-UUID`, so on the server side the device
  identifier, the portfolio name, the monthly budget, and the holding
  weights are all associated with one installation's user-generated
  content. Apple's definition of "linked" applies regardless of whether
  a human-readable user account exists — server-side association by an
  installation-stable identifier is sufficient.
- **Tracking = `false`** (all three entries): none of the collected
  values are combined with data from other apps or websites, shared
  with data brokers, or used to target advertising. The data flows
  only to the value-compass backend.
- **Purpose = `AppFunctionality`** (all three entries): the backend
  uses the identifier to scope a user's portfolios and to authorize
  subsequent requests, and uses the portfolio name / monthly budget /
  ticker weights solely to compute the value-compass contribution
  recommendation that is the app's core function. There is no
  analytics, product personalization, or third-party advertising flow.

If a future change broadens any of these (for example, if the
identifier ever flows to a third-party SDK, or if it ever drives
analytics/advertising surfaces), the manifest **and** the Connect
nutrition label must be updated together, and a Privacy Policy update
(#224) must accompany the change.

## Out of scope

- **Privacy Policy text and Settings link** (`#224`) — the human-readable
  version of the same disclosure. Must cover transmission of the
  portfolio name, monthly budget, and ticker allocations per #357.
- **App Review submission notes** (`#254`) — financial-tool framing.
- **`NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypes` (required-reason API)** — already
  shipped in commit `69af031` (PR #230 / closes #223) covering the
  one `UserDefaults` use site. No additional required-reason APIs
  are present in `app/Sources` as of the audit recorded in #271.

## How to update this declaration

If the collected data surface changes:

1. Edit `app/Sources/App/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` to add, remove, or
   reflag the relevant `NSPrivacyCollectedDataType` entry.
2. Update this file with the new entry, what flows through the
   network, and the linked/tracking/purpose flags chosen.
3. Re-file the App Store Connect "App Privacy" nutrition label with
   the same flags **before** the next submission.
4. Coordinate with #224 so the Privacy Policy text mirrors the new
   declaration.
